# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
This project aims to enhance the mobility and convenience of the public through bike-sharing programs in metropolitan areas. One of the main challenges is maintaining a consistent supply of bikes for rental.

# Problem statement:
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
# Dataset
The dataset is from Seoul's Bike Sharing Program. The data set includes over 8000 records and 14 attributes based on historical usage patterns, including temperature, time, and other data.For more information on the dataset, please visit the Kaggle website at
